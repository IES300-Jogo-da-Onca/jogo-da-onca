### Reflection

It was a profound journey of both cultural exploration and software engineering. Renowned by its original Bororo name, Adugo, this digital adaptation served as a captivating intersection of tradition and technology. Undertaken during the first semester of 2022, the project became a testament to four months of rigorous dedication, serving as a pivotal criterion for approval in the challenging Software Engineering III course at FATEC São Paulo. Under the insightful guidance of Teacher Victor Troitiño, who not only challenged but also mentored us throughout the project, we navigated the complexities of cultural preservation and coding intricacies. The gratitude we feel for his guidance is immeasurable, as he played a pivotal role in steering us through this multifaceted project, ultimately making the journey of "Jogo da Onça" a deeply rewarding and enlightening experience.
